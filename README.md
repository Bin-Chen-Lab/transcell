## Prediction of phenotypic and molecular measures through transfer learning based on gene expressions

Personalized cancer therapy drives the emergence of cell lines cultured from individual tumor tissues. Molecular characterization of these cells could gain a better understanding of individual tumors and provide rationale therapeutic options. However, obtaining comprehensive molecular characterization for a new cell line is not trivial when resources are very limited. Here, based on the cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE), we develop a transfer learning with deep neural network (TransCell), utilizing pan-cancer large-patient cohort to make predictions for protein expression, copy number variation, metabolite abundance, gene effect score, drug sensitivity, and mutation. In addition to TransCell, state-of-the-art traditional machine learning methods applied for feature selection, regression, and classification, and two different DNN designs are explored. The results show that TransCell has the best performance in metabolite, gene effect score, and drug sensitivity prediction. Lastly, we perform gene enrichment analysis of biological processes for well predicted and hard predicted features.

### Repository Structure
#### code
All the python scripts are run under the following environments:
- Pyhton version: 3.5.6
- tensorflow version: 1.10.0
- GNU Parallel

Take metabolite prediction as an example.
Commands to run scripts:
```
python generate_parallel_command_meta20.py > command.txt
```
```
nohup cat command.txt | parallel --joblog out.log -j5 &
```
```
cat *.out | grep 'avg_transfer_meta' > avg_transfer_meta_ks5000.csv

```

#### Further application
We could run the following scripts to predict the values of metabolte, gene effect score, and drug sensitivity for new cell lines by TransCell.

Metabolite:
```
python further_application_metabolite.py
```

Gene effect score:
```
python further_application_gene_effect_score.py
```

Drug sensitivity:
```
python further_application_drug_sensitivity.py
```

#### output
The prediction results for each individual type of feature could be found under the folders.
